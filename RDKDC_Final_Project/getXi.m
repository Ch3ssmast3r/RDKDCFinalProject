%g is the homogeneous transformation matrix in SE(3)

%We must account for two cases: 1) purely translational and 2) general case
if abs(theta) < 0.0001 %purely translational case. v is simply dependent on the p vector.

    v = p/norm(p);
    theta = norm(p);
else %more general case. 
    difference = R-transpose(R); %This is needed to calculate omega, using the general equation
    differenceV = [difference(3,2);difference(1,3);difference(2,1)];
    omega = differenceV/(2*sin(theta));
    %next we compute v. the equation is summarized in this matrix (A) such
    %that vA = p.
